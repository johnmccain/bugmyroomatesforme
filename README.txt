#BugMyRoommatesForMe:
This project was created in order to make utility payments with roomates easier. This is done by people being able to create a "Pad", to share with your roomates and set up payment organization schemes through an assisted automated proccess.  We all know how life can send us curveballs, so BugMyRoomatesForMe has built in algorithms to help housemates get back on track with bill payments.

This project was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, SCSS, and Gulp.
