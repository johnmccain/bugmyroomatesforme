#BugMyRoommatesForMe:
This project was created in order to make utility payments with roomates easier. This is done by people being able to create a "Pad", invite your roomates to this,
then being able to set up a plan for paying in an assisted automated proccess. This project was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, SCSS, and Gulp.
